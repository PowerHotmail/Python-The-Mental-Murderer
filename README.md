# Python-The-Mental-Murderer
A text-based murder-mystery game designed with Python. Originally created voluntarily for school! 

I originally created this game for school, completely voluntarily to show off my previous programming knowledge. I had a very, very basic understanding of Python; however, I learnt a lot from this project! Diving into something you don't know, makes you learn a lot!
